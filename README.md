**TL;DR: DO NOT OPEN THE CSV WITH MICROSOFT EXCEL**

## Generate AERO figures in R

This is an R script for generating simplified AERO figures<sup>1</sup> from a CSV formatted file.

## Requirements

* R v. 3.4.0
* readr v 1.1.0
* ggplot2 v. 2.2.1

## Recommendations

**DO NOT USE MICROSOFT EXCEL TO OPEN THE EXAMPLE CSV FILE.** (Or really, any other file for that matter.)

Why?

One of the columns contains dates, and Excel will re-format your dates and break the R script. Use OpenOffice or something, anything else.
